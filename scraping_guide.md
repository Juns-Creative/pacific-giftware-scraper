## Issue with Browser-Based Scraping

The full Selenium-based scraper requires a graphical browser environment which is not available in this containerized Replit environment. The simple HTTP scraper was attempted but Pacific Giftware's website appears to require JavaScript and login sessions to display product information.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Run Locally (Recommended)

Download your project files and run the scraper on your local machine:

1. **Download these files to your computer:**
   - `pacificgiftware_scraper.py`
   - `your_items.csv`
   - `requirements.txt`

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install selenium pandas beautifulsoup4 requests
   ```

3. **Install Chrome and ChromeDriver:**
   - Download Chrome browser
   - Download matching ChromeDriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/

4. **Set credentials and run:**
   ```bash
   export PACIFIC_EMAIL=junscre@outlook.com
   export PACIFIC_PASSWORD=pacific123
   python pacificgiftware_scraper.py your_items.csv results.csv --headless
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Verification

Visit Pacific Giftware manually to verify your items:
- Item 12238: https://www.pacificgiftware.com/product/12238

- Item 11982: https://www.pacificgiftware.com/product/11982

Log in with your credentials to see pricing and case quantities.

### Option 3: Cloud Browser Service

Use a cloud-based browser automation service like:
- BrowserStack
- Selenium Grid
- AWS Lambda with Selenium

## Your Project Files

All files are ready for download:
- **Main scraper**: `scripts/pacificgiftware/pacificgiftware_scraper.py`
- **Your items**: `scripts/pacificgiftware/your_items.csv`
- **Helper tools**: `scripts/web_scraper_tool.py`, `scripts/quick_scrape.py`
- **Documentation**: Complete README and usage guides

## Expected Results

When the scraper works properly, you'll get a CSV with:
- Item Number
- Product Name  
- Unit Price
- Case Quantity

For your items: 12238, 11358, 11982

The scraper will log into Pacific Giftware, visit each product page, and extract the pricing information that's only visible to logged-in wholesale customers.
